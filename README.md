# dynMRI

This software is dedicated to the estimation of rigid-body motions for the ankle joint in children from a stationnary high-resolution static MRI scan and a set of low-resolution dynamic MRI scans. It can be also adapted for other articulated structures such as the shoulder etc... 

### Project

In vivo dynamic evaluation of ankle joint and muscle mechanics in children with spastic equinus deformity due to cerebral palsy: Implications for recurrent equinus.

### Software requirements

The use of this software need the installation of FSL "https://fsl.fmrib.ox.ac.uk/fsl/fslwiki/FslInstallation".
Registrations are performed by FLIRT (FMRIB's Linear Image Registration Tool). Required softwares are available ready to run for Mac OS X and Linux (Centos orDebian/Ubuntu) - with Windows computers being supported with a Linux Virtual Machine.
You also need to install the Python package NiBabel: "http://nipy.org/nibabel/installation.html".
Data must be in NIFTI format "https://brainder.org/2012/09/23/the-nifti-file-format/". 

### Recommendations

  Inorder to respect the segmentation protocol, it is highly recommended to segment the tibia for a height of 35 mm. To count from the point of contact between the growth cartilage for the tibia on the one hand and the articular cartilage (tibia / talus) on the other hand.
  This software works well especially when the imaged FOV cover the entire structure of each rigid component (or bone of interest) both in the static and in time frames.
  Please keep your input masks in this order (mask1: calcaneus; mask2: talus; mask3: tibia). 

### Command Line Arguments
##### Example

python motionEstimation.py  -s /home/karim/Data/subject07/static07.nii.gz  -d /home/karim/Data/subject07/dynamic07.nii.gz   -m /home/karim/Data/subject07/segment/mask1.nii.gz   -m /home/karim/Data/subject07/segment/mask2.nii.gz   -m  /home/karim/Data/subject07/segment/mask3.nii.gz   -o /home/karim/Exp/septembre/jeudi/subject07/dynamic07/

-s | -d | -m | -o
  (required) 

    -s - filename of the 3D static image
    -d - filename of the 4D dynamic sequence 
    -m - mask filename : Accepted multiple times
    -o - Output path

### Program outputs
This program outputs a folder per component (or mask): (/outputpath/propagation/output_path_component_i_/). Final results of each component are then saved in a specified sub-folder: (/outputpath/propagation/output_path_component_i_/final_results/). 
Final results are:
 - segmentations of the low-resolution time frames
 - Direct transformations from static to each time frame
